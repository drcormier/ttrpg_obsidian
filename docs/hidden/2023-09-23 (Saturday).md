## Notes
- lots of doppelgangers
- finished a #fight against devils, vampires, and doppelgangers
- devils and demons could be bred and thus be native to the prime material plane
	- if there's a devil breeding ground, would be a target for demon forces
- entire floor has broken out in combat
- 8th level spirit guardians
