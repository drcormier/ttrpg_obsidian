This elf-killing curse was devised and inficted upon the kingdom of [[./Sevenarches|Sevenarches]] eons ago by Kaneepo the Slim (pages 92–93). After escaping their prison in the First World realm of Nighthold, Kaneepo created the obnubilate curse—sometimes called the obnubilate plague—from shadow stuff and malice as an act of revenge against their elven enemies. Luckily, Kaneepo’s reach from their umbral domain, the Thinlands, extended only so far. Ever since the night of the Missing Moment, the Seventh Arch no longer inficts the curse, but the Shadewither Key (above) still bears its taint. Any elf who touches the Shadewither Key contracts the curse. 
#### Player Character Immunity
Though at this point they can’t remember their meeting with Osoyo, the Blackfrost Whale, the player characters’ interaction with that powerful entity grants them a unique benefit in the context of this adventure: immunity to the obnubilate curse. Because the curse’s magic is tied up in the Shadewither Key along with Osoyo’s psychic imprint—an imprint which the characters also bear in the form of their gatewalker marks—creatures that have come in contact with the Blackfrost Whale are immune to the obnubilate curse, even if they’re elves.
