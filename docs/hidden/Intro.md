During a routine cargo job on a remote asteroid mining base you learn that one of the workers has disappeared. No blood, no body, no record of the airlock opening. Just gone.

What do the weird events around the base have to do with it? Who, if anyone, can be trusted? And can you make it out alive before you also disappear?
