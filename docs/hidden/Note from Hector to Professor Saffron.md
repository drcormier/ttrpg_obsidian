My old friend,

My time in Zilargo must be, unfortunately, cut short. I saw them - one of my cousins and my sister on the streets of Korranberg. I know not if they saw me, but I know better than to tempt fate. I shall return to Sharn as quickly as I possibly can. I have learned a great many things that I hope can set me free once and for all - and some worrisome news that are too dangerous to share over mail, even if encrypted.

I shall meet you at our usual spot. I have something M. is sure to find interesting.
