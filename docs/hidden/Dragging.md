## Grabbing a consenting Creature
A Creature may consent to being Grabbed. If this is the case, Grabbing that creature works differently:
- Grab automatically critically succeeds
- Grab loses the Attack trait
- Grab can be done without interrupting a Move action (though it still costs an action to Grab)
- Moving while a consenting Creature is Grabbed or Restrained causes the consenting creature to move with you. Moving in this state requires twice the normal movement.
- You may release the consenting creature at any time as a Free Action
A Player may voice their consent on behalf of any Creature they control, regardless of the state the Creature is in (An unconscious or dead Creature can still choose to consent or not, for example)
## Withdrawing consent
A consenting creature that is Grabbed or Restrained by you may withdraw consent at any time as a Free Action. If this happens, you must release the creature immediately as a Free Action or the Grab action reverts to the normal rules for Grab, and the required skill check for Grab must be made immediately.
