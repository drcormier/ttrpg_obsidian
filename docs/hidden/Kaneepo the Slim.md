# Kaneepo the Slim
## Origin
- Originated from the **First World**, a realm of spontaneous creation and experimental evolution.
- Woke up thousands of years ago in the shadowy realm of **Nighthold**.
## Identity
- Initially struggled with identity.
- Found similarities with bogeys and bogeymen due to their *slender forms* and *unsettling appetites*.
- Unlike bogeymen, Kaneepo feeds on victims' shadows and *umbral auras*.
## Appearance
- *Lanky purple humanoid fey* with shadowy lines around lower arms and shoulders.
- Shadow extends from their feet, showing a screaming creature.
## Journey in Nighthold
- Sought shelter in the court of **Count Ranalc**, Eldest of shadows and chaos.
- Felt lonely and began to see themself as the progenitor of a new fey race.
## Discovery of Wilewood
- Found a *carved leaf* and a *stone arch* that led to Wilewood.
- Started hunting elves in Wilewood and trying to evolve them into similar creatures.
## Imprisonment
- Captured by a group of elven heroes before Earthfall.
- Imprisoned in the First World inside a tree stump.
## Escape and Revenge
- Prison was broken due to planar shifts.
- Kaneepo gained power to shape a patch of First World around their stump.
- Developed a weapon to afflict elves: the **Obnubilate Curse**.
## After Earthfall
- Elves had fled to distant Sovyrian during Kaneepo's imprisonment.
- Retreated to the First World, to an area now known as the **Thinlands**.
## Current Endeavours
- Resumed attempts to create more of their kind.
- Recruited local gorgas for their quest.
- Aims to extend the Thinlands into the Material Plane, turning Sevenarches into a hunting preserve.
## Manipulation
- Searched for a way to get the Seventh Archâ€™s gate key from the Oakstewards.
- Found **Bolan**, a rebel Oaksteward, ripe for manipulation.
## Physical Description
- 8-foot-tall, hairless humanoid with a rail-thin, pale slate body.
- Oversized mouth with flat teeth.
- Strips of flayed skin cling to forearms, capable of capturing shadows.
