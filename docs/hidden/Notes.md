The Book of the Raven is the firsthand account (written in Common) of an anonymous author who, after falling off her horse and breaking her leg, was rescued and befriended by [[./Vistani|Vistani]] travelers who graciously nursed her back to health. The author and her horse traveled with the [[./Vistani|Vistani]] for three months, during which the author spent most of her time laid up in a [[./Vistani|Vistani]] covered wagon, where she took to writing this book to pass the time. Although a dozen [[./Vistani|Vistani]] are colorfully described in the tome, only two are mentioned by name: [[./Drasha|Drasha]], a teenaged girl who applied bandages and poultices to the author’s wounded leg, and [[./Darzin|Darzin]], a one-armed boy with a terrible fear of wolves who sang beautiful songs to help the author take her mind off the pain.

> [!NOTE]
The book provides a detailed account of the [[./Vistani|Vistani]] way of life, with emphasis on their food and music. Their overland journey is also discussed, albeit from the viewpoint of one who spent most of it inside a covered wagon. The author describes rough roads, days of travel through impenetrable mist and thick forest, crackling fires on cold nights, wolves howling in the dead of night, and ravens pecking at the roof of the wagon in the wee hours of the morning.

> [!NOTE]
Late in the book, the author writes of being able to hobble about on crutches. She describes the cheery mood of her benefactors as the [[./Vistani|Vistani]] caravan traveled a winding mountain road to the gates of a tall, dark castle. The book ends with a description of the castle’s dreadful countenance. The writing abruptly stops on the third-to-last page, suggesting that the book was snatched from the author in midsentence. The last two pages are blank.

> [!NOTE]
The [[./Vistani|Vistani]] are planar travelers often encountered in the [[./Shadowfell|Shadowfell]], and they seem to be immune to the despair that besets all other visitors to that plane. They travel in horse-drawn, barrel-shaped wagons and have no permanent home.

> [!NOTE]
The [[./Vistani|Vistani]] display their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, sharing their good fortune with friends and strangers alike. [[./Vistani|Vistani]] resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling.

> [!NOTE]
[[./Vistani|Vistani]] families can be big or small, but each family is a gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder has most of the responsibility for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group’s travels, and preserving the [[./Vistani|Vistani]] way of life.

> [!NOTE]
The [[./Vistani|Vistani]] have the power—some say gift—to travel through the mists that lead to forlorn realms within the [[./Shadowfell|Shadowfell]] known as the [[./Domains of Dread|Domains of Dread]], where creatures born in darkness dwell. This “gift” was thrust upon them by mysterious entities called the Dark Powers, as a boon for their kindness toward strangers.

> [!warning] 
The [[./Vistani|Vistani]] believe that ravens carry lost souls within them. Hence, killing a raven is considered bad luck in [[./Vistani|Vistani]] culture.
