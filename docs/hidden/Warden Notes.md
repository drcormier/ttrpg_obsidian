**NPC DISAPPEARANCE**: Every 10 min. of real time or every 1-2 hrs of game time the Monster strikes. Roll a d10 on the [[./NPCs|NPC CHART]] to see which NPC is killed. If a PC is alone, the Monster will attack them instead. 

**MONSTER MOVEMENT**: Whenever the crewmembers enter a new location on the map, roll 1d10. If the number rolled matches that location's number, they encounter the Monster there. 

**FAILURE**: If the players leave the base without finding out about and dealing with the monster, it follows them onto their ship. 

**VENTS**: Any room with a Vent icon connects to any other room with the same icon. Somewhere in the vents is a discarded yellow cassette: CASSETTE #2. There is an EMERGENCY CONTROL PANEL within one of the vents that has all the same functions as the WORKSPACE COMPUTER TERMINAL [2].
