## Background
### Under what Conditions Was This Character Born? (socioeconomic, Environmental, etc.)
She was born in [[./Sharn|Sharn]] to a low-ranking member of [[./House Orien|House Orien]], Therius d'Orien, and an unknown mother. Due to this, she was often looked down upon and given low-quality or problematic jobs that others didn't want to deal with.

### What Was This Character Doing before They Met the Party?
She is on the train back to [[./Sharn|Sharn]], working with other members of [[./House Orien|House Orien]] to ensure the proper operation of the train, and to deliver a secret message on behalf of [[./The Boromar Clan|The Boromar Clan]].
### What Motivation Does This Character Have to Work together with the Party?
Thanks to her dragonmark and connection to Syrania, she has attracted a surprising amount of attention from watching eyes due to her speed and efficiency in delivering messages. Due to this, she is looking to use an adventuring party as a way to provide plausible deniability and to gain more power, wealth, and status. She also has a great deal of respect for the other members of the party for their ambitions.
### What Was The Event That Caused This Character To Become An Adventurer?
While growing up and doing simple jobs in [[./Sharn|Sharn]], she learned her missing mother used to be a member of [[./The Boromar Clan|The Boromar Clan]], before she was *erased*. At this point, Myca realized how powerless she was, and how much power, fame, and status would be needed to never have the problems her two parents had in life. At this point, she resolved herself to do whatever it took to rise above those that looked down on her.
### What Are This Character's Goals?
To rise in rank/status in [[./House Orien|House Orien]] and/or [[./The Boromar Clan|The Boromar Clan]]
### What Are This Character's Motivations?
She wants to be in a position where nobody looks down on her anymore, and nobody ridicules her for being low-ranking.
