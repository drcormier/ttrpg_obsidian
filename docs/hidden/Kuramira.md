# Kuramira
## Class And Race
Eladrin Level 6 Bard / Level 1 Sorcerer
## Appearance
5ft tall, 90lbs. Snow white hair that glitters and shines like real snow. Elvish features. Skin is a pale white with a slight bluish tint. Irises look like a rotating storm of colors and sparks, representing the influence of the Feywild's wild magic on her.
## Personality
- Kuramira experiences emotions very strongly, and these emotions can change rapidly.
- Given the dangerous, magical nature of the Feywild, Kuramira is always looking for a way out of the current situation.
- Kuramira sees teammates as necessary, even if all that means is using them as decoys to escape.
- Given her upbringing, she sees using magic as a normal thing to do.
## Backstory
- Kuramira comes from a clan of Eladrin and other fey races living in the Feywild.
- This clan has a long history of magical power, to the extent that all people born or brought into this clan develop and pursue magic in one form or another.
- Kuramira studied magic as a Bard, learning how to sing, give speeches, and perform while infusing magic.
- Unlike most bards from the Material Plane, Kuramira studied her magic in a more analytical manner, similar to magical schooling wizards undergo but in a more homeschooled manner.
- As a result, she sees her performances merely as a means to an end to produce magical effects.
- After a certain amount of schooling, members of the clan are sent out to the Material Plane to gain experience, after which they will return to become teachers for the newer generations.
- Kuramira was sent out through a portal near [[./Glaverus|Glaverus]] where she entered.
- She asked a guard for basic information about the city, and charmed him to get the information when the guard was uncooperative.
- Arrested for using magic on a guard.
## Ideas
### Idea 1: Returning to the Feywild
- Given a one-time-use [Boon of Planar Travel](https://5e.tools/rewards.html#boon%20of%20planar%20travel_dmg) to return to the Feywild when she is suitable to be a teacher for the following generations
- Heavy restrictions on use or punishment if used contrary to instruction
### Idea 2: Fragment of Suffering
- Adding a [Fragment of Suffering](https://5e.tools/rewards.html#fragment%20of%20pity_crcotn,flsttype:fragment%20of%20suffering=1,floptype:extend) might be an interesting way to spice things up
- [Fragment of Rancor](https://5e.tools/rewards.html#fragment%20of%20pity_crcotn)
	- Assuming attacks only implies spells with attack rolls, I only have two of them (Fire Bolt and Ray of Frost)
- [Fragment of Intransigence](https://5e.tools/rewards.html#fragment%20of%20intransigence_crcotn)
- [Fragment of Attachment](https://5e.tools/rewards.html#fragment%20of%20attachment_crcotn)
### Idea 3: Tie in with [[./Celestia|Celestia]]'s Story
- She met [[./Celestia|Celestia]] or one of her associates on her way in to [[./Glaverus|Glaverus]] and got roped in to the spy business in some capacity
