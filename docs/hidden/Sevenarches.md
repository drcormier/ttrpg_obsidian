Sevenarches was long plagued by the [[./Obnubilate Curse|Obnubilate Curse]]—a mysterious affliction that erased the memories of elves and half-elves before it killed them. The curse has recently been lifted, but the people of Sevenarches still bar elven characters from their settlement, afraid that any change to their longstanding ways might result in some unforeseeable catastrophe. Elves and half-elves caught by the kingdom’s guards are politely but firmly escorted to the River Kingdom’s border.
