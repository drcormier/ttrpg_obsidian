## Backstory
They say knowledge is power. I know all too well how true that statement is.

Growing up as a half-drow half-human, I wasn't particularly *wanted* in most groups of people: humans, elves, drow elves, even regular half elves. As a result, I found myself growing up on the streets of Waterdeep.

After some time, I managed to gather a small group of comrades together. Other unwanted kids, just like me. We organized and executed several small stakes "heists", where we stole from various stores and small organizations around Waterdeep to help keep us alive.

I found myself falling into more of the mastermind role in the group. While I took part in our heists, I often handled planning and execution. This meant more work for me, but I was happy to help the group. Little did I know what was in store for me.

After years of shouldering this extra work for the group, all I was rewarded with were their knives at my neck. "They could do it better themselves," they said. "One less mouth to feed," they said. If only I had known this would happen.

In the immense stress of the standoff, my psychic powers awoke. Using my psychic blades, I managed to *neutralize* all the people I once called friends. Even after what had happened I never planned to kill them, but the brain damage ultimately claimed their lives.

If I had known what was going to happen, I would have done things differently. Associated with different people. Broken up the group before it came to *that*. Found ways to make ends meet solo. After killing my so-called friends, I came to understand just how powerful knowledge is. This understanding has led me to become an information broker: finding, collecting, *hoarding* information. The money from selling what I've learned is just icing on the cake.

On that day, my fate was decided by my ignorance and luck. But never again will I allow my fate to be decided by my ignorance.
